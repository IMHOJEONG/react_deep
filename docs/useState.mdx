### useState를 깊게 파보자

```javascript
ƒ useState(initialState) {
  var dispatcher = resolveDispatcher();
  return dispatcher.useState(initialState);
}
```

- console.log에 useState를 출력한 결과

- resolveDispatcher 함수의 경로를 찾아보자

      );
    }
  }
  // Will result in a null access error if accessed outside render phase. We
  // intentionally don't throw our own error because this is in a hot path.
  // Also helps ensure this is inlined.
  return ((dispatcher: any): Dispatcher);
